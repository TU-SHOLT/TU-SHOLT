- 👋 Hi, I’m Sean Holt. Recently left the Corporate Finance world to pursue development. I was tired of score keeping. I needed a change. 

- 👀 I’m interested in deepening my knowlege base in Java, Pythong, JavaScript, MERN and making more beautiful, quicker and responsive websites. I would eventually like to be able to produce mobile apps. 

- 🌱 I’m currently expanding on my project matchdayplanner and want to include sorting and assigning algorithms based on experience and designated times. 

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on new projects that involve any of the above 


- 📫 How to reach me by messaging me here or on my linkedIn Page.
